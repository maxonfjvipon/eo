# Test.
# The test seems not obvious, but it illustrates `cage` side effects well.
# Here when `sum.write (x.plus 1)` is dataized `sum` needs to check if given
# object has the valid form - `int.plus`. But `x.plus` does not have form at
# the beginning because attribute `plus` in not taken from `x` yet.
# So to get forma this `plus` is taken from `x`. As the result we get object
# `42.plus` which means `42.plus.^` is `42` and it won't be changed.
# That's why `x.write 7` rewrites value of `x` but does not affect `42.plus` and
# does not affect `sum`.
