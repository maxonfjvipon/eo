# Test.
# @todo #2931:30min Enable or remove bool tests. Object bool.while stopped working properly when
#  \rho attribute became immutable. Need to either remove the tests or refactor and enable them.
#  Tests: iterates-over-simple-counter, complex-bool-expression-in-while,
#  last-while-dataization-object, while-without-last-dataization,
#  last-while-dataization-object-with-false-condition,
#  iterating-tuple-with-while-using-internal-iterator,
#  iterating-tuple-with-while-using-external-iterator,
#  iterating-tuple-with-while-without-body-multiple, iterating-tuple-with-while-without-body-single
